Covid-19 has been spreading across the country at an alarming rate. To help people be better informed and prepared, we have built an application that lets you track cases of the virus in your city or state. The app offers you to track all the cases of Covid-19 in India and also tracks each state separately, providing historical data for each state from the start of the pandemic. It also provides a list of preventive measures that you can take to avoid the virus.
